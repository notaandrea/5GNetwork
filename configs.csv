Configuration Parameters,Value,Comments,,,,,,,,,
Channel bandwitdh ,20 Mhz,100 RBs (180 kHz each RB),,,,,,,,,
Tx Power,5 dBm,We can increase this to have lower delay,,,,,,,,,
Target Bler,0.000001,Set for URLLC Apps,,,,,,,,,
Packet Size,2000 Bytes,We can increase this to have lower delay,,,,,,,,,
Fading and shadowing,Disabled,MCS varies depeding on the distance,,,,,,,,,
RB Allocation,Distributed,or Localized,,,,,,,,,
Scheduling Policy,MAXCI,"or DRR,PF,MAXCI,MAXCI_MB,MAXCI_OPT_MB,MAXCI_COMP,ALLOCATOR_BESTFIT",,,,,,,,,
Distance UE0 and GNB,Variable (sinusoidal),,,,,,,,,,
Distance UE1 and GNB,400 m,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTES: timestamp of MCS and latencx are different because the MCS is sampled every 1 ms while the timestamp of the latency depends on the latency itself,,,,,,,,,,,
